### Testing:
    Everything must be tested!

### Unit Tests:
- Ensure module works
- Runs on a Continuous integration server
- Focus on the smallest parts
    - Methods & functions
- Gives immediate feedback
- prevents time consuming debugging
- executable documentation (how its designed to be used)
#### How to write 
func setup() - used to setup prior to the test
func teardown() - used to tear down the previous test
func test_<intention>() - the specific test that will test the feature.
<br>
<br>There is a simple pattern syntax for this:
<br><code>
    setup()
    .
    .
    .
    test_...
    .
    .
    .
    .
    teardown()
</code>
<br>By following this test are efficiently created in a way that you can
test multiple functions within a single setup.
<br>

### Specifc test name syntax
Becuase test cases are not included in production, they should be expressive 
and named in detail for what they do:
<code>
test_<FunctionName>_<ContextForTrue>()
</code>

### Value of code
Tests should be meaningful.
Dont test things that dont need it (think simple assertions, or guarnatees)
For example, getters or accessors that are 1-lined may not need a test, but 
mutators unless extreemly simple (simple setter) probably will in almost every case.

### Test input/cases

Use sections to test your data, (Equivallence Partitioning)
- Using this strategy allows you to test a variety of your data and get the same\
coverage as if you had selected everything between them
