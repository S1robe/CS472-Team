## 9-18-23 Notes about Testing

coverage = # of covered items/(# of lines of code) * 100%
Includes

1. Statements
2. Branch coverage
3. path coverage
4. mutation coverage

Test coverage can reveal what lines of code are not tested or may have 
undefined behavior.

Using the command tool "python-coverage" you can generate a report over a 
python script and generate a report that details what lines are not covered.

100% test coverage does not mean bug free
---

It just means that you have good quality, but not zero bugs.

Statement coverage is just if your code has executed the lines O(n) n = # lines
Branch coverage is for if you have covered both sides of all conditionals (if) O(2n) = n
Path coverage is covering all possible paths for conditionals O(2^n) 

Test Driven Development
---

Write the tests first ( what you want it to do ), then
<code>Write the code</code>

XUnit: Junit, PyUnit, Nunit, EmbUnit
Jasmine for JS
Mocha for Node.js
Simplest for PHP

#### Code Creation Method:
1. Write tests that fail...
2. Write code that sufficiently addresses the test
3. Run again: FAIL -> Restart; PASS -> Write another test.
